## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This was a bit easy. The major take was using css rules to place more than one background images.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<body> 
  <div> </div>
</body>
```
```css
.body {
  background-image: url(bg-pattern-top.svg), url(bg-pattern-bottom.svg), linear-gradient(135deg,hsl(185, 75%, 39%) 50%, hsl(185, 75%, 39%));
  background-size: 50% 70%, 50% 70%, 100% 100%;
  background-position: top left , bottom right, left;
  background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
}
```



### Continued development

In this project, I could not place the background-images as seen from the design. So, this is what I have to work on. Also, I will still consider working on the responsiveness to screen sizes.

### Useful resources

A lot of resources was helpful not just in this project but from the beginning of my learning of web development.

- And lots more. Surely, I will always recommend them days in and days out
